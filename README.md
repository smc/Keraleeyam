Keraleeyam is a Malayalam font designed by Hussain K. H. 

Keraleeyam is a thick ornamental font. It is basically a san-serif font but it takes
a thin and thick design especially at the joins of straight and curved paths. 
Bigger and thicker, it is condensed compared to Meera and Rachana. Its geometry
follows a vertical oval shape rather than circular. Keraleeyam is best suited to titles.
Many book covers have been designed using this font. When Keraleeyam is used for
signboards its Roman glyphs may find a suitable space.

Keraleeyam font was originally designed in 2005. The current version of the font is based
on comprehensive character set of traditional Malayalam script with many unique conjuncts.
Latin glyphs were designed and added to match the malayalam sript style in 2015.

The font is maintained by Swathanthra Malayalam Computing project.
